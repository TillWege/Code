# Code
Most of my Stuff inside one singular Monorepo. Some of this is managed through seperate Repositories, other stuff (especially if its just a small Project / Tool) is just loosely commited into this repo.

# Project inside this Repo

## Dotfiles
Settings and a setup-script for a consistent-ish Linux-Experience across multiple Systems
## Games
Games I made (mostly for university)
## Legacy

## Stuff
All the random-projects I cant properly categorize
## TillWege

## Tools
Things I (try) to build that might even serve a usefull purpose
## University
